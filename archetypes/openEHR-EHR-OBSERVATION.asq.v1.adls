The items address three important aspects of user satisfaction with device usability: ease of task completion, time to complete a task, and adequacy of support information (on-line help, messages, and documentation). The ASQ items use a 7-point Likert-scale from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (7), and a not applicable (N/A) point outside the scale (Lewis, 1995)">
